## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Priya Senthilkumar and this is my GitHub where you can see all the cool stuff that I am working on.  
I took a break from projects to focus on grinding Leetcode, but now I am eager to create new projects and showcase my skills more!
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a stock screener using Python and other data analysis tools
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about financial data analysis
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects related to financial analysis, machine learning, web development, and more
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with expanding my current tech stack and creating cool new ideas together!
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything related to web development and data analysis, and anything else non technical related :)
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: https://www.linkedin.com/in/priyakumar0817/ or priya.kumar817@gmail.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm left handed!
